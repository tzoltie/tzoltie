# Hi there, I'm Tim 👋

I am a passionate **Software Engineer** with a solid foundation in front-end and back-end development as I am a graduate from Boolean - a six month intensive full stack course with over 1000 hours of study and practical learning. I have a deep understanding of modern web technologies and frameworks, and I love creating efficient, scalable, and user-friendly applications.
